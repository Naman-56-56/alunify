This is a placeholder file for the default avatar image.

To implement the default avatar image:
1. Create or obtain a square profile image (preferably 200x200 pixels)
2. Save it as "default-avatar.jpg" 
3. Place it in this directory (static/images/)

The default avatar is used when a user doesn't have a profile picture.
